### React Router:

- 3rd party package

### why routing ?

1. when no routing

- Hit refresh you are lost
- cannot bookmark

2. When you have routing

- App will be Organized(Professional outlook)
- Ease of access
- Sharing URL (Sharing is caring)
- Secure route (login while entering)

### - In old days routing is used in MPA. But it takes more time to load.

### How to get smooth interface of routing in SPA?

- By installing the `react-router-dom`
- Installation Step : npm<space>i<space>react-router-dom

- technic - when you want to see a particular page, it will hide the other page.
- Eg: If you want to see `contact` page means , it hides the `about` page and shows only the `contact` page.
- So this the big application of `conditional rendering`.

### `react-router-dom version 6.4 is new one... not used on more application. so we go for version 6.3

`Steps: This is common for all packages installation.`

If you exactly want the particular version means do like this `npm i react-router-dom@6.3` here `@6.3` is the version.

- npm<space>install<space>react-router-dom@6.3
- You can also do like this: npm<space>i<space>react-router-dom@6.3
- If you want to work with latest version means you don't need to mention the version. Just do like this `npm i react-router-dom`
  For eg:
- npm<space>install<space>react-router-dom
- You can also do like this: npm<space>i<space>react-router-dom

`To check whether the package is installed or not by src -> package.json -> dependencies -> see the package & its version`

### Installation setups (procedures) are mostly available in chrome.

google search -> packagename with version -> you can see the procedures (steps) under installation sub heading.
Eg:`https://reactrouter.com/en/v6.3.0/getting-started/installation`

Step:1 import `BrowserRouter` from `react-router-dom` to `index.js` file
Step:2 wrap your app in `<BrowserRouter>`
Now you can use React Router anywhere in your app!
Step:3 replace the default markup with some routes and create your route components
Step:4 Create route path
Customer can't move pages by entering the links.
Step:5 Create links.

- In general we use anchor tag for page navigation. But when you use that it refresh your page every time. So it will affect smooth performance of SPA property.
- So we go for link tag `<Link to="/">Home</Link>`
- Link tag navigate the pages without refreshing the page.

### Hash vs / Browser router

- Hash router:

1. Older browser
2. Eg: IE
3. Works both in new and Old browsers

- Browser router:

1. Newer browsers
2. Additional features
3. Only in new browsers

### How to convert Browser router to Hash router:

- Instead of using `BrowserRouter` use `HashRouter`

### Routing Flow:

`User` -> Nav link (URL Changes- Routes Trigger) -> `Routes` (Contain bunch"group" of route) -> `Route` (Matches URL to the component) -> `Screen display`

### Redirect

-When you land in 404 page

1. People typing random in URL
2. No longer the page exists
   `*` -> matches any path
   `<Route path="*" element={<NotFound >}/>`

### When do you redirect

1. Brand acquisition
2. Marketing team - trends
3. Security
   // /films -> /movies
   <Route path = "/films" element={<Navigate replace to="/movies" /> }/>

### Lifting the state up technique

-App(data)
-> (props) MovieList(data)
-> (props) AddColor(data)

- Here, we are lifting the data in the MovieList to App for to share the data to AddColor. Why because , you can share the data through props (Parent -> Child(props))
- MovieList & AddColor are siblings App is the parent for them.

### Routing hooks - useNavigate

Use it when you want to change URL programmatically (clicked on a button)
`Eg: changing URL programmatically` when you buy an order from shopping App (after payment), it automatically redirected to tracking page(Successfully ordered page). If the payment failes it goes to retry page (Error page).

- Here, the user not going to success page/error page, we programmed to go to the pages automatically.
- This can be done by useNavigate hook

-> `useNavigate - Functionalities`

1. navigate("/about) -> about page
2. navigate(-1) -> backward üîô - 1 page backward
3. navigate(1) -> forward ‚è© - 1 page forward
